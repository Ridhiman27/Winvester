# Winvester
A platform for recommending your investment portfolio for stocks, mutual funds, real estate and other assets

### Motivation
Diversification of assets and different investment instruments is necessary to have a low-risk investment portfolio. 
Diversification of assets requires study/research regarding that asset depth. News, expert advice, and user research are necessary to be able to consider an instrument as investable.
 As this requires a lot of time and effort, a lot of investors make a hasty decision and end up losing money in the market. 
There are a lot of perks to investing in the right asset at the right time and to empower and help people in investing we decided to build this application.

### Problem Statement
A system that can suggest you an investment  portfolio based on your risk appetite, funds to be  invested, and profit you would like to see in the  future. For this, we are assessing the risks involved  and the profits made by the investments using  historical data and for some of the investments, it  is real-time data. We are trying to create a system  that can suggest a diverse portfolio with minimal  research by the users. Some of the investments  include government schemes, mutual funds, forex,  stock market, land, gold, commodities, etc. We will  also be looking toward tax-saving investments.

### Objectives
1.) To enable users to curate a portfolio based on their risk appetite and the amount of capital they have.

2.) Features in the final product will include a choice between different assets and investing options and suggestions.

3.) To develop algorithms specified to different assets and incorporate into the application in order to ensure minimum risk and maximum profit.

4.) To assess the overall market sentiment related to a particular asset and combining it with strong fundamentals.

5.) To reduce the user involvement, effort and time required to research about an asset by recommendation.
