### Motivation
Diversification of assets and different investment instruments is necessary to have a low-risk investment portfolio. 
Diversification of assets requires study/research regarding that asset depth. News, expert advice, and user research are necessary to be able to consider an instrument as investable.
 As this requires a lot of time and effort, a lot of investors make a hasty decision and end up losing money in the market. 
There are a lot of perks to investing in the right asset at the right time and to empower and help people in investing we decided to build this application.
